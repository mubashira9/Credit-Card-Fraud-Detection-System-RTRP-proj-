The financial industry has experienced a substantial transformation with the advancement of machine learning (ML) technologies, which offer powerful tools for detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions. Traditional fraud detection systems often depend on predefined rules and manual reviews, making them inflexible and slow to respond to new fraud tactics. In contrast, machine learning models can analyze vast amounts of transaction data, detect hidden patterns, and adapt to evolving fraud behaviors in real-time.

Machine learning algorithms operate by learning from historical transaction data and identifying subtle anomalies that may indicate fraud. These models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, can distinguish between genuine and suspicious activities based on features like transaction amount, location, time, and customer behavior. By continuously learning from new data, ML systems can improve accuracy and reduce false positives, helping financial institutions minimize losses and enhance customer trust. This project explores the implementation of such models for credit card fraud detection, showcasing how data-driven approaches can revolutionize financial security systems.
